    - 'My first girlfriend was a wild sheep. Like many wild sheeps of her age, she
      smelt bad, and her fur was always a mess. She was a bad sheep. These are the
      very first things I would notice when she would pick me up in her brand new
      car. I would get in, kiss her and smell cigarettes and booze in her breath.
      Then, I would gently touch her coarse fur. I felt powerful and limitless. '
    - "This memory got buried with her a long time ago, after she died. But last year,
      a regular dream brought it back. \r\nIn this dream, I hear someone knocking
      on my door in the middle of the night. I get up and I walk to the door. I open
      it, it is pitch black. I can\u2019t see, but I smell cigarettes and booze. I
      stretch my arm out the door frame, and I feel a rough, coarse fur."
